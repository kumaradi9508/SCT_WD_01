    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Mahendra Singh Dhoni, born on 7 July 1981 in Ranchi, Bihar (now Jharkhand), is a former Indian cricketer and one of the most successful captains in the history of Indian cricket. Known for his calm demeanor, sharp mind, and explosive batting skills, Dhoni led India to victories in the ICC T20 World Cup (2007), ICC Cricket World Cup (2011), and ICC Champions Trophy (2013).
    </p>
    <p>
      Dhoni is also the only captain in the history of cricket to win all three major ICC trophies. He was the captain of Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the IPL and won multiple titles with them. He is a wicketkeeper-batsman and has a large fan base due to his humble nature, helicopter shot, and leadership qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahendra Singh Dhoni, fondly known as "Mahi", "Thala", and "Captain Cool", is one of the most iconic figures in the history of cricket. Born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Jharkhand (then Bihar), Dhoni rose from humble beginnings to become one of the greatest cricket captains the world has ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially a goalkeeper in football, Dhoni‚Äôs destiny changed when he was encouraged to try his hand at cricket. He started his journey as a ticket collector at the Kharagpur Railway Station, working for the Indian Railways, all while honing his cricketing skills in domestic matches. His fearless batting and helicopter shots soon caught the attention of selectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      MS Dhoni made his ODI debut for India in 2004. Though his debut match wasn‚Äôt impressive, he soon proved his worth with a blistering 148-run knock against Pakistan. What followed was an era of unmatched success and leadership. Dhoni was appointed captain of the Indian T20 team in 2007, leading a young squad to victory in the inaugural ICC T20 World Cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under his captaincy, India climbed to the No.1 Test ranking for the first time, won the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy ‚Äî making him the only captain to win all three ICC trophies. His calm demeanor under pressure earned him the nickname ‚ÄúCaptain Cool‚Äù.
    </p>
    <p>
      Known for his signature ‚ÄòHelicopter Shot‚Äô and sharp wicketkeeping reflexes, Dhoni redefined the role of a finisher in limited-overs cricket. He was a master strategist who led by example, often promoting himself in pressure situations ‚Äî like in the 2011 World Cup final where he scored 91* and sealed victory with a six that will be remembered forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Indian Premier League (IPL), Dhoni captains the Chennai Super Kings (CSK). Under his leadership, CSK has won multiple IPL titles (2010, 2011, 2018, 2021, and 2023), and he remains the heart and soul of the franchise.
    </p>
    <p>
      On August 15, 2020, Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket through an Instagram post, marking the end of an unforgettable chapter in Indian cricket. Despite his retirement, he continues to inspire millions through his presence in the IPL and his calm, composed personality off the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond cricket, Dhoni is a successful entrepreneur, co-owner of multiple sports teams, and a proud member of the Indian Territorial Army, holding the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      MS Dhoni's legacy is one of humility, excellence, and unwavering determination ‚Äî a true legend who changed the face of Indian cricket forever.
